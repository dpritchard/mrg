# MRG MATLAB Toolbox (Archive)
This is the README file for a MATLAB toolbox that was, at one time, under development by the [Marine Research Group (MRG)][mrg] at [QUB SPACE][space]. 

As of May 2022, it has been more than 7 years since anyone has interacted with this repository. The primary maintainer (Pritchard) hasn't used MATLAB since at least 2014. As a result, this repository is being archived. At some point in the future it will be deleted. 

## Documentation
[Documentation for this toolbox][mrg_docs] is hosted here on GitHub in a [separate repository][mrg_docs_repo].
